# CSE-274-Final-Project
Final project for CSE 274 - Data Structures &amp; Abstraction

The project is a simple program to simulate the interaction in a DVD rental store. The program has a list of movies,
and a list of customers. Customers, once in the system, can check out DVDs from the list of available movies using
their customer ID number. After they are done, they can go back into the system to return the DVD. The store keeps
track of which customers have which DVDs checked out, as well as the availability of each DVD in the store.
